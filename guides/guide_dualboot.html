        <!-- Your guide content here -->
        <p> Suppose you freshly installed Linux alongside Windows in the same machine, then there 
            are several "sync" issues need to be taken care of. The solutions has been tested in my
            specific cases of pop_os! and Windows. They should
            work for most distributions.
        </p>

        <h4>Time not in sync<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></h4>
        <p>
            For timezone, Linux calibrates clock according to Universal Time Coordinated (UTC),
            whereas Windows uses local time from your location. Thus, if you reboot into Windows
            from Linux, you will see that clock differs by several hours - Windows has incorrect time.
            The most straight
            forward way is to fix it within Linux to let it read local time:
            <pre><code class="language-bash"> sudo timedatectl set-local-rtc 1 </code></pre>
            Then, this issue is resolved. If you wish to revert the setting, set 1 to 0.
        </p>


        <h4>Bluetooth not in sync<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup></h4>
        <p>
            Shout out to power users <a href="https://github.com/spxak1">spxak1</a> and <a href="https://github.com/x2es">x2es</a>!
        </p>
        <p>
          If you would like to use the same bluetooth device, say headphone,
          on both OS, you need to tweak a bit after initial pairing for each
          OS. Out of the box, after paired on Linux and then paired on Windows, 
          boot back to Linux, you will find the headphone is not working.
        </p>
        <p>
          Bluetooth device, once initially paired, generates a unique key, 
          and this key does not sync between different systems. Thus, we need to sync it
          manually, preferably working from Linux terminal, if you do not want to mess with
          Windows registry.
        </p>
        <p>
          <a href="https://github.com/spxak1">spxak1</a> detailed the guide using
          <code>chntpw</code> <a href="https://github.com/spxak1/weywot/blob/main/guides/bt_dualboot.md">here</a>. 
          Once followed through, my headphone Sony WH-1000XM5 worked for both Pop_os! and Windows
          without re-pairing!

        <p>
          Alternatively, <a href="https://github.com/x2es">x2es</a> has written a <a href="https://github.com/x2es/bt-dualboot#advantages-and-alternatives">Python program</a> to
          automate the process, but it did not work for me. Try it yourself!
