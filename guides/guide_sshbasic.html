        <p>
            Secure Shell Protocol (SSH) is a cryptographic network tool.
            One of the most common usages is remote server access. For example, one can use SSH 
            connecting local Git repository to Github, which negates the input of Github account
            password every time and is considered much safer.
        </p>

        <h3>Keygen</h3>
        <p>
            SSH as a command line tool is available natively on MacOS, Linux, and 
            newer Windows. For these system, the terminal syntax should be similar if 
            not the same. The idea of SSH is to use public and private key cryptographic 
            method to safely establish connection between local and remote. We generate the 
            keypair by 
            <pre><code class="language-bash">ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your-comments"</code></pre>
            Note that <code>-t</code> flag specifies which cryptographic algorithm one is using, in our 
            case <code>ed25519</code>, and <code>-C</code> flag prompt a comment along with your key file.
            Why <code>ed25519</code>? 
            <a href="https://medium.com/risan/upgrade-your-ssh-key-to-ed25519-c6e8d60d3c54">Some</a> 
            argues that <code>ed25519</code> is faster, safer, and more efficient 
            than the famous <code>RSA</code> algorithm. I like its short and compact public key compared
            to its <code>RSA</code> counterpart.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once type the command, you will be prompted to enter a file location and file name to save the keypair, 
            typically in your <code>home/usr/.ssh</code> folder. Make sure you name it something sensible 
            or go ahead with the default location. For demonstration, let's say you set
            <pre><code class="language-bash">/home/usr/.ssh/id_ed25519</code></pre>
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, you will be prompted to enter a passphrase. In the event someone has access to
            your drive, especially your keypair file, they must enter the passphrase in order to
            use your keypair. Thus, passphrase is your last defense. At this point, your keypair 
            is generated, namely, two files <code>id_ed25519</code> and <code>id_ed25519.pub</code>
            are generated in your <code>.ssh</code> folder. It is okay to share the <code>.pub</code>
            file since it is your public key, but never expose <code>id_ed25519</code> (no suffix) to anyone.
        </p>

        <h3>ssh-agent</h3>
        <p>
            You have the key generated, then what? Who manages
            your key? ssh-agent! ssh-agent is a background process that handles the key, you must add
            your key to the agent for it to be usable. In certain operating systems, ssh-agent is a start-up 
            process that automatically starts on boot, and sometimes it also automatically add your key file
            after generated. However, not all system has this feature, so should you want to start the process manually,
            type
            <pre><code class="language-bash">eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"</code></pre>
            Then, add your key by 
            <pre><code class="language-bash">ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519"</code></pre>
            Note that you added your private key to ssh-agent rather than your public key. 
            At this point, your key is ready to be used. For example, you can 
            <pre><code class="language-bash">cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub</code></pre>
            then <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account">paste your public key to Github</a> to enjoy
            password-less user experience while knowing it is safer than conventional password!
